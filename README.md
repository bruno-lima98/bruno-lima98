# 👨‍💻 Bruno Lima  
**`Data Analyst` | `Data Scientist`**

Hello! I'm Bruno, 27 years old, and I’m constantly improving myself in the Data field.  
I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Unicamp and have been working as a Data Analyst for about two years.

After focusing my career entirely on Data Analysis, I decided to deepen my knowledge in Data Science and Machine Learning.  

This repository is my space to share personal projects, practical experiments, and my learning journey in the world of data.  

Feel free to explore and follow along!

## 📝 Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my portfolio of **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** projects.  

Here you'll find case studies, experiments, and end-to-end workflows, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation and deployment.

Each folder contains one independent project, complete with code, documentation, and datasets.

### 🚀 Goals

- Apply Machine Learning and Data Science to real-world problems.
- Demonstrate end-to-end workflows, from data collection to model interpretation .
- Build a solid portfolio using primarily Python, SQL, and Cloud tools.
